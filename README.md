### Integrating Public Transport and Urban Development Datasets for Strategic Planning

#### Overview
This project aims to integrate datasets related to public transportation usage and building completions in Abu Dhabi to facilitate strategic urban planning. By analyzing these datasets together, stakeholders can gain insights into the relationship between urban development and public transport infrastructure.

#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- GeoPandas
- Matplotlib

#### Installation
bash
pip install pandas geopandas matplotlib


#### Usage
1. **Load Datasets**: Ensure you have the datasets available in the specified formats: an XLSX file for building completions and a CSV file for public transport usage.
2. **Run the Analysis Script**: The provided Python script loads and merges these datasets. It then computes correlation metrics and visualizes the relationship between building completions and public transport usage.
3. **Visualize Results**: The script generates a bar graph showing the trends over time.
4. **Export Merged Data**: The merged dataset is saved as a CSV file for further analysis or sharing.

#### Example Command
bash
python integrate_datasets.py


#### Output
- A correlation matrix is printed to the console, highlighting the relationship between building completions and public transport usage.
- A bar graph visualizing these trends is displayed.
- The merged dataset is saved as `Merged_Transport_Building_Data.csv`.

#### Further Exploration
- Utilize the merged dataset to explore other potential correlations or trends.
- Consider additional datasets, such as healthcare facilities, to further enhance urban planning models.
